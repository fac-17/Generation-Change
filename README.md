## Talking you through the project

This project was built over three week long sprints - the first was a design sprint, and this was followed by two build sprints.

### Design Sprint

During this week, we refined our key [user journey](https://github.com/fac-17/Generation-Change/wiki/08.-User-Journeys) and our [user stories](https://github.com/fac-17/Generation-Change/wiki/09.-User-Stories). We also put together our [prototypes](https://www.figma.com/file/hGRdFiJBUSRzSzAAlDqv9G/Generation-Change?node-id=6%3A610).
